Wow #hyunsookim
It should be a great day at the park, because it's Bomber Cap day! 
Byung-Ho Park is on pace to hit 51 home runs this year for the Twins
Most home runs in Twins history through 17 career games

SeattleMariners #mariners #Seattle #mlb Korean call of Dae-Ho Lee's walk-off homer is amazing
