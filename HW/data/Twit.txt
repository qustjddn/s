Manny #Machado is a freak of nature dude.. Guy just makes plays that no one else would dream of! #Orioles #PlatinumGlove #MannyBeingManny
Hey #Birdland, let's just use this as an excuse to bask in the glory that #Machado is our third baseman
Machado needs to be signed for 20 years. #Machado #Orioles

#Park goes yard for @Twins to bring them within 2 of @Brewers, down 5-3. Interesting thing is the fan almost fell out of the deck! @MLB
@Twins awesome #PARK!!!
Any day the @Twins get better is a good day! #Park
Amazing? #Maeda #Kenta
He is also good at painting.
Kenta Maeda is proving to the @Dodgers why they made the right choice to sign him. 3-0 with a 0.36 ERA?!? #Maeda #gododgers
Dodgers win! #LADodgers #Maeda 
#Maeda was spectacular tonight! #Dodgers
I Love LA! Dodgers Win! Player of the game Maeda! Of course he pitched a gem! #Dodgers #Maeda
Wow we can possibly be witnessing the beginning of greatness... #Maeda #Dodgers https://www.instagram.com/p/BEkIbiUKtbw/
Thanks a pantload, Pedro Baez. #fantasybaseball #Maeda
#Maeda just proved he can get himself out of a pickle. Great composure.
My fantasy baseball team would have 50% more homers if pitchers' hitting stats counted. #Maeda #Bumgarner
No need for Greinke. We got ourselves a new ace. #bleedblue #RossStripling Kersh tmrw. #maeda #DodgersVsGiants
Shout out to Kenta #Maeda who maede-a homerun in his #mlb debut with the @Dodgers yesterday!
This makes me so happy #GoDodgers #maeda #ITFDB
On a serious note loved everything about the kid , mostly the emotion he displayed after an important out #Maeda #Dodgers
"ICYMI: Video: Kenta Maeda Homers in Major League Debut >> http://goo.gl/6vx84h  #Dodgers #LetsGoDodgers #Maeda "
The #sweep is #complete! #Kenta #Maeda #shines in his #MLB #debut and the #Los Angeles #Dodgers¡¦ https://www.instagram.com/p/BD5CkWyK26b/

#sweep great start for #kentamaeda #maeda #mlbdebut lets keep it¡¦ 
Kenta Bomb Highlights Dodgers Historic Start #DodgerFam #Maeda #Dodgers #ShutoutStreak #MLB #MLBHistory #Baseball
THIS. IS. AMAZING.??
I wish every one of these Japanese fans could be to every game at #ChavezRavine. @Dodgers #Maeda 
Love Kenta's demeanor #Maeda #DodgersWin #Sweep
I love it when baseball dugouts give players the "silent treatment" after they hit a home run #Dodgers @dodgers #Maeda
@Dodgers I hope Dave Roberts didnt promise @18kentamaeda dinner for each HR cause it looks like its gonna get expensive. #LADodgers #Maeda
First MLB Appearance and got a HR #dodgers #maeda struck out first up vs #Padres @Padres
I am so going to enjoy watching this season when #Kenta #Maeda starts!! The best is yet to come @Dodgers #WeLoveLA #Dodgers #sweep
Dodgers with the 3 game shutout sweep ???????? Maeda with the last shutout and first homerun  #dodgers #dodgerblue #welovela #maeda
This guy made a hell of an impact on his debut #Dodgers #dodgersvspadres #maeda
Once again baseball shows that pitchers can hit home runs as well #maeda
#Maeda had a great debut and injuries aside, the #Dodgers will be a force with a better offensive that many think and a staff on the mend
Little nervous watching the @Twins on TV today. Hopefully the game is closer than it was last night. #cmontwins #sundayfunday #park #sa
#hyunsookim will surly be booed running down carpet during opening day if he's on the roster #orioles #openingday
The fact that #HyunSooKim has a clause in his contract that says he can refuse being re-signed to the minor leagues is complete horseshit.
Hyun Soo Kim¡¯s Agency Says He Won¡¯t Accept Minors¡¦#BaltimoreOrioles #HyunsooKim #Newsstand #mlb #fantasybaseball
Baltimore @Orioles¡¯ Korean OF #HyunSooKim ¡®On the Bubble¡¯ #onthebubble @MLB
#HyunSooKim still hitless (0 for 21), @Orioles winless (0-9) 
@SteveDavisBmore isn't too worried about #HyunSooKim's start for the #Orioles during spring training...yet.
Tyler Tyler Collins. Do you understand you want the fans on your side. You deserved to get booed. That should not have happened. #Tigers #Collins
Holy Cow are you kidding me right now? @tigers #Collins WOW, saying F-U to the fans and flipping them off.....good luck Pal
Way to be classy #Collins! Waving your middle finger to the crowd
That had to be the silliest way to lose a consecutive scoreless innings streak 
If you drop a fly ball, you might want to pick it up. You might not want to flip off your fans either. #TylerCollins 
the worst thing I have ever seen done at a sporting event in Detroit I have attended over 1200 games in the city
Detroit #Tigers player #TylerCollins loses one in lights, loses cool, flips off fans. Did he go too far? 
#tylercollins "fuck em all" to the Tigers fans! Time to go back to minors and stay there Tyler. #byefelicia
Keuchel is doing his job out there but the Astros offense is not doing crap 
in spaceships they won't understand and me i ain't ever gonna understand this shit! lets #gostros #houstonastros
Holy shit he hit that fucking ball up there! #houstonastros
When people were talking shit all season long and still talking shit 
I feel like a girl that can't take the hint that her boyfriends a pice of shit #HoustonAstros #istilllovethem
The #HoustonAstros are the most profitable team in baseball. That is so pathetic how teams get away with that shit
Yooooo them #houstonastros are garbage!!! Wow they better get they shit right!!
Not even the players give a shit. #houstonastros #baseball
That ball was trapped! Get your shit together @MLB replay umpires in New York. Incompetent as fuck! #Giants
This team will absolutely lose 100 games this year. #Twins Fans need to stop going to Twin games immediately. FUCK THE POHLAD'S!
Watching the Twins is like beating yourself in the head with a hammer. #Jepsen
#Jepsen is horse shit. Fuck you #Twins
Braves we're going to be abysmal in 2016. Gonzalez can't make chicken soup with chicken s**t
The #Braves are really bad at baseball.  11-4 #Braves lose again in BOS/ATL.  They're here to play the #Cubs Friday-Sunday.
#Braves lose again. Out of 20 games to start the year, they've won only 4 of then. Fall 11-4 to the #RedSox and to 4-16 on the year.
This whole it's all about live sports/content has bubble signs. The money does have to come from somewhere. #Greinke deal
#Molina is a little ole bitch! Fuck the #Birds Fuck the #Cards Fuck Molina ole fuck boy ass bitch!
King Bitch was benched? Hope he doesn't throw a tantrum #Puig
Your a fucking bitch #puig. Sit down   Go roll some cigars #STLCards #STLvsLAD #NLDS
Glad his bitch ass didn't win #espn #puig the media ballooned his head
@BestFansStLouis "@redbirdsalm: @eddiegreen82 He's a little bitch! I wish he's thugs would find him. Take him back to Cuba" #Puig
I hate that fucker! Punk bitch! #puig #fuckLA #SFGiants
If you going to talk shit at least put your name next to the quote don't be a pussy #Puig is not the worst person in baseball
That's what you fucking get, Dave Roberts for taking out Ross Stripling during his no-hitter because of "pitch count." Pussy managing. #MLBs
Yes, #TylerCollins did indeed give #DetroitTigers crowd the finger.. And mumbled "F*** everybody".
